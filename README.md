## Introduction

This project is a basic implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using C++ and object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts. The game allows two players to take turns entering their moves on a 3x3 board until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.

The project is organized into multiple header files (`tictactoe.h` and `TicTacToe.h`) to separate the class declaration from the implementation, promoting modularity and maintainability.

## How to Use
Follow the prompts to play the game. Enter the row and column numbers (0-2) to make your move.
## Contributing
You can use this code if you want and improve it any way you want.
